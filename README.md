# This is a test task for a Paydoo front-end vacancy.

# Currency Conversaion Tool

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3.

Develop a currency conversion app to convert values from a provided currency to USD and from USD to a provided currency. 
Use public API to get exchange rates: 
● https://docs.openexchangerates.org/ 
● API key/App ID: 0e99a90e26224cc285f0d8f8cc7cadf2 
● this is a free plan, only /latest-json can be used

As requested in task - you can easily convert USD to provided currencies by API. But to convert those currencies to USD need a different plan, or there is a issue with app ID here is a error

{ "error": true, "status": 403, "message": "not_allowed", "description": "Changing the API base currency is available for Developer, Enterprise and Unlimited plan clients. Please upgrade, or contact support@openexchangerates.org with any questions." }
